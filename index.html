			 <p>Took a few hours on my day off to try out the Lomograflok back. Used it with the Intrepid with a 150mm/f5.6 lens - the 90mm Nikon doesn’t fit.</p>
<p>I came away a bit disappointed that I had to waste a box of Instax Wide to figure out that the film needed to be exposed at around ISO 4000 in bright light instead of ISO 800, which is the rated box speed.</p>
<p>Finally got some semblance of a decent exposure, but that was almost 2 hours in.</p>

			 <p>Not the best cabling job in the world, but it’s probably as good as it gets. I feel like the PC case industry is ripe for standardization and cable buses #cablemanagement</p>

			 <p>Just found out that MaximumPC, a magazine I’ve followed since the 2000’s, has finally closed. They wrote good articles, didn’t have trashy advertisers and always added a hint of humor. It was as much of my computing journey as my college degree was. I’m going to miss it very much.</p>

			 <p>I was about to go down the rabbit hole of setting up yet another blog. But thankfully, I somehow ended up finding micro.blog, so here I am.</p>
<p>Ideally, I just want to post my musings, in the form of short bits of text and my photos, and have that cross-posted out to the rest of the Fediverse.</p>
